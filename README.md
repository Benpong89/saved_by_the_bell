Saved by the Bell is a free resource for public school teachers and administration seeking volunteers to facilitate After School programs. Public schools often overlook the importance of After-School programming and may not have the resources to recruit volunteers. Our mission is close this gap, by bringing the volunteers to the teachers with Saved By the Bell.

Prospective volunteers can create an account and list their availability, specialties by category, location and other relevant information. Teachers can search through published volunteer profiles by category and/or location, and directly contact the volunteers.

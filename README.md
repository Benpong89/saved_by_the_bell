**Saved by the Bell**

Saved by the Bell is designed to support public school teachers by connecting them with volunteer after school program facilitators. I developed the concept and application from the ground up, drawing inspiration from my prior experiences as an AmeriCorp.

**How it works:**

Prospective volunteers can create a profile and list their availability, specialties by category, location and other relevant information. Teachers can search through published volunteer profiles and directly contact the volunteers.

**How you can help:**

_“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is,
What are you doing for others?” — Martin Luther King, Jr._

Not a public school teacher? That's OK! Volunteering can be as easy as facilitating an existing after school program for one afternoon, tutoring a student preparing for the SATs, or teaching a dance class once a week.

Upcoming features:

1.  Volunteer profile picture
2.  Teacher verification process
3.  Review volunteers
